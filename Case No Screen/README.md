# OpenHAK Case Without Screen

These files are based on work done in TinkerCAD. Here is a [LINK](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fX1sQ4hkvQ3/edit?sharecode=MBpM_lOcDwo09Hl9wH52ejLc3BFAfVf-uOjMw0ZpjG0=) to the original design. If you want to customize your own case, the most important thing to retain is the **negative space** inside the case so that it fits all the inner workings of the OpenHAK.
