# OpenHAK_Case

These files are based on work done in TinkerCAD. There are two case designs here. One is without a screen, and the other is with a screen designed for the BioHackin Village Badge for DEFCON 27. Check those files for links to the original design files. If you want to customize your own case, the most important thing to retain is the **negative space** inside the case so that it fits all the inner workings of the OpenHAK.
