# OpenHAK Case With Screen For DEFCON 27 BioVillage Badge

These files are based on work done in TinkerCAD. Here is a [LINK](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/d1GiTQ276Ym/edit?sharecode=lXj4qQmqEE36Ka18K03_-tFvXx0bUg2BYQZelCi3PQs=) to the original design. If you want to customize your own case, the most important thing to retain is the **negative space** inside the case so that it fits all the inner workings of the OpenHAK.
